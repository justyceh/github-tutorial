# Github Tutorial

Created readme.md file first!


## What did we do

We just changed the file, we are gonna now commit this change
git status === this command when ran list all of the things you have modified in your project folder
but not yet commited yet

You might also notice if you add a new file and run git status, it will show that the file is untracked, inorder to track the file we need to add it using git add -A for all or git add . which adds everything new
we can also directly add something by using its name like git add index.html

# Github Workflow vs Local git workflow

Github workflow
1. Write code
2. Commit changes (no need to push since we are in the repo)
3. Make a pull request

Local git workflow
1. Write code
2. Stage changes (git add .)
3. Save changes (git commit -m "")
4. Push changes (git push -u origin main/master)
5. Pull request
