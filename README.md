# Github Tutorial

Created readme.md file first!


## Subheader

We just changed the file, we are gonna now commit this change
git status === this command when ran list all of the things you have modified in your project folder
but not yet commited yet

You might also notice if you add a new file and run git status, it will show that the file is untracked, inorder to track the file we need to add it using git add -A for all or git add . which adds everything new
we can also directly add something by using its name like git add index.html
